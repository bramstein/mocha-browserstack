## Automatic browser testing with Mocha and BrowserStack

This Mocha reporter allows you to run your unit tests automatically on one or multiple BrowserStack instances.

## Installation

    $ npm install mocha-browserstack

## Usage

Include the reporter in your HTML test page. The reporter extends the default HTML reporter so your tests will continue to work as expected locally.

    <script src="node_modules/mocha-browserstack/lib/mocha-browserstack.js"></script>
